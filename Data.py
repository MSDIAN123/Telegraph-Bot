Hey {}

Welcome to {}

I'm a **𝕿𝖊𝖑𝖊𝖌𝖗𝖆.𝖕𝖍-𝖀𝖕𝖑𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊𝖗 𝕭𝖔𝖙**
I can upload media to telegra.ph and give you back the link with ease. Try sending multiple media, and it still won't stop me.
I can also be used in groups !!

To see `Supported Media Types` tap the related button below.
Use the other buttons to know more about me and my usage.

**READ BELOW TO KNOW HOW TO USE ME.**

See `Supported Media Types` by clicking that related button below.

**How to use me here?**
Just send the media and leave rest on me. 

**How to use in group?**
Add to me the group.
Then reply to a media with /telegraph to get the telegra.ph link.
You can alternatively also use "t" or "tg" as commands and "!" as prefix to do the same.
That is,
!t   ,   !tg   ,   !telegraph 
/t   ,   /tg   ,   /telegraph
[If you add in your group, your group users won't need to join our channel.]

__Note__ : If the bot doesn't respond in the expected way, make the bot admin so that bot gets updates for sure. Telegram is weird.

More features in development. Keep track by joining @ImDark_Empire.
